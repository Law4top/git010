Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will experience and learn how to resolve a common challenge in version control: merge conflicts. You will work with a simulated scenario where conflicting changes are made to a shared code repository. Your task is to resolve the merge conflict effectively.

Instructions:

Part 1: Setting Up the Scenario

1. Create a new Git repository on a platform of your choice (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) or use a local repository. Initialize it with a README.md file.

2.Create two branches: `feature/branch-A` and `feature/branch-B` from the main branch (or `master` branch). Ensure that both branches have divergent changes.

3.Make conflicting changes in each of the two feature branches. For example, modify the same line of code in a shared file (e.g., README.md) differently in each branch. Commit these changes to their respective branches.


Part 2: Simulating the Merge Conflict


4. Try to merge `feature/branch-A` into `feature/branch-B`. You should encounter a merge conflict due to the conflicting changes made in step 3.

5. Explain what a merge conflict is and provide a clear description of the conflict that occurred during the merge attempt.

6. Document the conflicting code snippets in a text document or as comments in your code. Clearly indicate which lines are in conflict.

Part 3: Resolving the Merge Conflict

7. Use your preferred Git client or command-line tools to resolve the merge conflict. Your resolution should ensure that the code is both correct and meaningful. Provide a step-by-step description of the conflict resolution process, including the commands used.

8. Commit the resolved changes with a meaningful commit message that explains the resolution. Be sure to include both branches (`feature/branch-A` and `feature/branch-B`) in the commit history.

9. Attempt to merge `feature/branch-A` into `feature/branch-B` again. Ensure that the merge is successful without any conflicts.



Submission Guidelines:

- Your assignment should be typed and well-organized.

- Include code snippets, Git commands, and clear explanations where necessary.

- Provide a link to your Git repository (if online) or include the relevant files and history (if local).

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Successful setup of the Git repository and branches

- Accurate simulation of a merge conflict

- Effective resolution of the merge conflict
